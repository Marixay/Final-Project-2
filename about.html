            <p class="special"><em><strong>"The opposites, art and administration,
            are a killer combo.
            I have coordinated design teams, and I'm able to
            succeed as an independent remote designer or as a
            team player that clearly communicates with others
            integrating design teams and orientating people to
            succeed though time administration and collaborative
            positive feedback."</strong>

                <p>I have been part of the team that produced <a href="https://wanuskewin.com/experience/tours/" alt="Link to Wanuskewin Museum web page" target="blank"> Wanuskewin museum</a>, every year from places outside of Canada. They come to Wanuskewin to learn about early North American civilization and to celebrate First Nations culture. With artifacts that predate the ruins of Rome and the pyramids of Egypt, Wanuskewin stands alone as a window into some of the continent's earliest inhabitants.</p><br>
                <p>I have also been part of the team that produced <a href="https://manitobamuseum.ca/whats-on/" alt="Link to the Manitoba Museum" target="blank"> Manitoba Museum.</a> A Winnipeg institution since 1970, the Museum has educated generations of Manitobans, as well as national and international visitors to our City. The responsibility of telling a people's and a geography's story is an important one; one that requires a lot of thought and attention to detail.</p><br>
